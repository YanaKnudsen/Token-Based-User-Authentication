# Token-Based-User-Authentification
This project provides a secure, token-based authentication solution for web applications. It includes a complete backend setup for handling user sign-ups, logins, and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This token-based system supports scalable, stateless authentication, allowing users to authenticate without needing to manage sessions on the server.
